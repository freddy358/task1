    <article>Oh, say can you see,
        <br>
        by the dawn's early light,
        <br>
        What so proudly we hailed
        <br>
        at the twilight's last gleaming?
        <br>
        Whose broad stripes and bright stars,
        <br>
        through the perilous fight,
        <br>
        O'er the ramparts we watched,
        <br>
        were so gallantly streaming?
        <br>
        And the rockets' red glare,
        <br>
        the bombs bursting in air,
        <br>
        Gave proof through the night
        <br>
        that our flag was still there.
        <br>
        O say, does that star-spangled
        <br>
        banner yet wave
        <br>
        O'er the land of the free
        <br>
        and the home of the brave?
